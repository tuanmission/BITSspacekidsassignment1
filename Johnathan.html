                <h2>Jonathan Yip s3855142</h2>
                <p>-I have been with technology for a long time but never really went anywhere else but games. Now I am trying to learn what made my younger self so happy with technology and to see what other possibilities there are in the world. I am looking to further build my knowledge in the IT industry as well as sharpen my skills in programming to build a stable career in the future.</p>
                <p>-So far, I have had some experience in programming languages such as C, java, python and some web programming. I am very interested in the gaming side of programming that allows endless possibilities to be made. </p>
                <p>-I only have basic knowledge of html and CSS, so once it goes into JavaScript and PHP I will not be as useful. However, I am willing to research about how they work and apply it to our project.</p>
                <p>-Hopefully my role allows me to build knowledge and experience in working efficiently in a team and challenges me in my weaknesses. </p>
